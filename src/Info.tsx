      <h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Finn. I have been coding for about 5 months. I've been learning React since Christmas and looking at Typescript in the last few days. Woohoo! 🐣
      </p>
      <p>
        But although I'm a rookie, I have never been so excited about learning. It's been a pretty life-changing process actually. I am dicovering more everyday and having a great time as I go. I especially love functional programming and trying to write elegant logic with Javascript! 🪄
      </p>
      <h2>Thank you 😊</h2>
    </div>
