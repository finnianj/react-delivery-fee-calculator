      <h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Finn. I have been coding for about 5 months, so it's all very new. I've been learning React since Christmas and looking at Typescript in the last couple days.🐣
      </p>
      <p>
        But although I'm a rookie, I have never been so excited about learning. It's been pretty life-changing actually - I know this is what I want to do. I especially love Javascript and writing cool functions! 🪄
      </p>
      <p>
        I know there will be some great programmers applying, so to be honest, I would be very grateful just to get some feedback on my code if you have the time. 🙇‍♂️
      </p>
      <h2>Thank you 😊</h2>

      <p>
        <em>P.S: I used to work for Wolt back in 2020 - Greetings to Marvin and Chris!</em>
      </p>
